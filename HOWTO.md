## How to use HouseCurve

### Connecting to an audio system
HouseCurve sends test sounds to your audio system and measures the result using a microphone. This is shown in the diagram below.

HouseCurve can connect to the audio system using AirPlay or Bluetooth. Tap the AirPlay button at the bottom of the screen to see a list of outputs.

Alternatively, the headphone connector can be used to create a wired connection to the audio system.  Use a Lightning to 3.5mm adapter.

HouseCurve will default to using the built in microphone of your iPhone/iPad.  These microphones are quite accurate and are suitable for most tuning tasks.

For additional accuracy, HouseCurve can use external microphones.  It will automatically use an external microphone if one is connected to your iPhone/iPad.

HouseCurve has been tested with the following external calibrated microphones:

When CarPlay is used to connect to an automobile audio system, be aware that the selected microphone will be the automobile (head unit) microphone, not the iPhone/iPad microphone.  It may be possible to override this by connecting an external microphone to the automobile.  Alternatively, connect using Bluetooth or the headphone connector.
