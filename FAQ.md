## FAQ

### Why HouseCurve?
I installed some ceiling speakers in my kitchen and couldn’t get them to sound right.  Most of the solutions I tried, such as my amplifier’s built-in room correction, were designed around creating a perfectly tuned single listening location.  This was problematic for a kitchen as there isn’t a “listening location”.  It’s a listening area.  I was quite happy to trade a single perfect sounding location for acceptable sound throughout the kitchen.  I created HouseCurve for this use case: capturing an average in-room response and tuning the audio system to a reference curve.  I was quite happy with the results, so I decided to make HouseCurve available to others.

### Why isn’t a flat reference curve included?
I discovered through trial and error that a “flat” in-room frequency response sounds way too “bright”.  Admittedly this didn’t square with what I though I knew about tuning an audio system.  I believe I was confusing the on-axis anechoic frequency response of a speaker, which is ideally flat, with in-room frequency response, which is what your ears hear.  I thus decided to exclude a flat curve because folks like myself would have chosen it and been disappointed.  But don’t take my word for it, try it for yourself: [Flat Reference Curve](/examples/flat.txt).

Upon further research, it appears that most listeners prefer highs to be rolled off to some degree.  [1](https://www.bksv.com/media/doc/17-197.pdf), [2](http://www.aes.org/e-lib/browse.cfm?elib=17839), [3](http://seanolive.blogspot.com/2009/11/subjective-and-objective-evaluation-of.html).
