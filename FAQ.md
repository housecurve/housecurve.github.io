## FAQ

### Why HouseCurve?
I installed some ceiling speakers in my kitchen and couldn’t get them to sound right.  Most of the solutions I attempted (amplifiers built-in room correction, etc) were designed around creating a perfectly tuned single listening location.  This was problematic for a kitchen as there isn’t a “listening location”.  It’s a listening area.  I was quite happy to trade a perfect sounding listening location for acceptable sound throughout the kitchen.  I created HouseCurve for this use case: capturing an average in-room response and tuning the system it to match a reference curve.  I was quite happy with the results, so I decided to make HouseCurve available to others.

### Why isn’t a flat reference curve included?
I found that a “flat” in-room frequency response sounded way too “bright”.  I was initially shocked by these results, but it turns out that most [listeners prefer highs to be rolled off](https://www.bksv.com/media/doc/17-197.pdf).  I recommend trying it for yourself: [Flat Reference Curve](/examples/flat.txt).
