## FAQ

### Why HouseCurve?
I installed some ceiling speakers in my kitchen and couldn’t get them to sound right.  Most of the solutions I tried, such as my amplifier’s built-in room correction, were designed around creating a perfectly tuned single listening location.  This was problematic for a kitchen as there isn’t a “listening location”.  It’s a listening area.  I was quite happy to trade a single perfect sounding location for acceptable sound throughout the kitchen.  I created HouseCurve for this use case: capturing an average in-room response and tuning the audio system to a reference curve.  I was quite happy with the results, so I decided to make HouseCurve available to others.

### Where can I use HouseCurve?
HouseCurve currently supports two channel audio systems.  If you can connect HouseCurve to the audio system, it will work.  I have used it for tuning home stereos, televisions and cars.

### HouseCurve shows me how my audio system sounds, but how do I tune it?
It depends on your audio system and where it is located.  Here are some basics: The most direct way to tune your system is to adjust the equalizer or bass/treble knobs.  If you have a subwoofer, then you can also adjust the volume, phase and lowpass frequency.  Move your speakers closer to a wall to increase low frequencies.  Drapes and bookshelves (with books on them) can lower high frequencies through absorption / diffusion.  Make one small adjustment at a time and use HouseCurve to see the effect.  Over time, you’ll learn what works for your system.

### Why isn’t a flat reference curve included?
I discovered through trial and error that a “flat” in-room frequency response sounds way too “bright”.  Admittedly this didn’t square with what I thought I knew about tuning an audio system.  I believe I was confusing the on-axis anechoic frequency response of a speaker, which is ideally flat, with in-room frequency response, which is what you hear in the real world.  I thus decided to exclude a flat curve because folks like myself would have chosen it and been disappointed.  But don’t take my word for it, try it for yourself: [Flat Reference Curve](/examples/flat.txt).
