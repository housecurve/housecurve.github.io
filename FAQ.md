## FAQ

### Where can I use HouseCurve?
HouseCurve supports two channel audio systems.  If you can connect your iOS device to the audio system, HouseCurve will work.  It has been used for tuning home stereos, televisions and cars. 

### HouseCurve shows me how my audio system sounds, but how do I tune it?
It depends on your audio system and where it is located.  Here are some basics: The most direct way to tune your system is to adjust the equalizer or bass/treble knobs.  If you have a subwoofer, then you can also adjust the volume, phase and lowpass frequency.  Move your speakers closer to a wall to increase low frequencies.  Drapes and bookshelves (with books on them) can reduce high frequencies through absorption / diffusion.  Make one small adjustment at a time and use HouseCurve to see the effect.  Over time, you’ll learn what works for your system.

### Why isn’t a flat reference curve included?
When listening to music, most listeners prefer in room frequency responses with roughly a 3 db/decade downward slope.  A flat response tends to sound overly “bright”.  However, HouseCurve can import custom curves, so try it for yourself: [Flat Reference Curve](/examples/flat.txt).
