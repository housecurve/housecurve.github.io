# Quick Start

1. Connect iPhone/iPad to the audio system using [AirPlay, Bluetooth or the headphone connector](usage/connection.md).
1. Set volume to a low setting with the iPhone/iPad volume buttons.
1. Tap <img src="/assets/img/measure.png" alt="Measure" width="15"> to start measurement process. HouseCurve will play a test signal through the audio system.
1. Adjust volume to a normal listening level, repeating measurements as needed.  If measurements are not successful, increasing volume *slightly* may help.  Excessive volume levels indicate a microphone problem (ex: blocked by case or hand).
1. Measurements are displayed on the plot in green, the target curve is displayed in yellow with a +/- 3 dB band.  When tuning, the goal is to get the average measurement within the target band.
1. Collect additional measurements by tapping <img src="/assets/img/measure.png" alt="Measure" width="15">
1. Remove the most recent measurement by tapping <img src="/assets/img/undo.png" alt="Undo" width="15">
1. Clear all measurements by tapping <img src="/assets/img/reset.png" alt="Reset" width="15">
1. Switch between plot types tapping <img src="/assets/img/pageleft.png" alt="Page Left" width="15"> or <img src="/assets/img/pageright.png" alt="Page Right" width="15"> or swipe left/right from the edge of the screen.
1. Tap plot to show cursor, move with single finger, tap again to hide.
