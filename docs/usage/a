./listening_area.md:A single measurement represents how the audio system sounds at a single location.  To get a realistic measurement of the listening area, it is important to average measurements from several locations.  [Averaging](../manual/plot_setup.md#plot-mode) will cancel small variances making it possible to find a “best fit” tune for a given listening area.  For a desk (near field), try measuring from 2-3 locations.  For a living room, try 3-5 locations.
./measurement_process.md:* Lower the [Coherence Blanking](../manual/plot_setup.md#coherence-blanking) threshold.
./measurement_quality.md:When [Coherence Blanking](../manual/plot_setup.md#coherence-blanking) is enabled, only portions of the measurement that are above the selected signal to noise ratio will be displayed.  This is a helpful indicator of measurement quality.  
./subwoofer.md:Use [Coherence Blanking](../manual/plot_setup.md#coherence-blanking) to ensure the plots only show portions of the measurement that are actually from the subwoofer and not simply noise.  The plot below shows a subwoofer measurement with Coherence Blanking turned off.  As can be seen, the plot shows a peak where the subwoofer is actually able to produce sound.  The rest of the measurement is the noise floor of the audio system and room.
./subwoofer.md:When separately adjusting main and subwoofer speakers to the same target curve, it is recommended that the [Target Curve Fit](../manual/plot_setup.md#target-curve-fit) setting be switched to manual and a suitable level entered.  The target curve will then appear at the same level for all measurements.  In the examples above, the target curve was fixed at 24.5 dB @ 100 Hz.
