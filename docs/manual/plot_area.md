- **Target Curve** The [Target Curve](plot_setup.md#target-curve) is displayed on the magnitude plot in yellow with +/- 3 dB bands. The phase and group delay plots always have a target of zero.

- **Measurements** Measurements are displayed on the plot in green.

- **Cursor** Tap plot area to show cursor, move with a single finger, tap again to hide.

- **Measurement Status** HouseCurve displays the status of the [measurement process](../usage/measurement_process.md) in this area.  The status disappears after a few seconds.

- **Setup Status** HouseCurve displays setup information in this area.  The status disappears after a few seconds.

- **Zoom / Scroll** To zoom into a plot, pinch anywhere on the plot area.  The plot can be scrolled left or right with two fingers.  Plot zoom and scroll only change the horizontal frequency axis.  HouseCurve automatically sets the vertical axis of the plots to show the measurement.
