The Filter Export screen can be accessed by tapping <img src="/assets/img/export.png" alt="Export" class="app-icon"> on the Equalize screen.

{: .app-portrait-right }

## Format
See [filter file formats](file_formats.md#filters).

## Sample Rate
The sample rate for the exported settings (ie: equalizer, not the audio source).  This setting is hidden for file formats that don't need a sample rate, ex: parametric EQ settings.

## Export
Tap to initiate the file export.
