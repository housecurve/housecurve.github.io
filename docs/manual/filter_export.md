## Format
The export file format, see [filter file formats](file_formats.md#filters).  This setting is hidden for FIR filters, which are always exported as impulse responses (WAV).

## Sample Rate
The sample rate for the exported filter (ie: rate used by equalizer).  Choose "all" to export for all supported sample rates.  This setting is hidden for formats that don't require a sample rate.

## Export
Tap to initiate the file export.
