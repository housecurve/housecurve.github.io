## Target curve and points
The editor supports curves with up to 20 points.  Drag points to adjust the curve.  Add points with a single tap.  Remove points with a double tap.

The [target curve fit](plot_setup.md#target-curve-fit) setting controls how curves appear on the plot.  The curve can be auto fit to a saved measurement (if selected), otherwise the curve is shifted to the manual setting.

## Cursor
A cursor will appear when a curve point is dragged.  It displays the frequency and un-shifted value (ie: as it would appear in a curve file, before curve fit is applied).

## Reset Curve
Tap <img src="/assets/img/reset.png" alt="Reset" class="app-icon"> to discard changes to the target curve.  This button is disabled when there are no changes.

## Save Curve
Tap <img src="/assets/img/save.png" alt="Save" class="app-icon"> to save changes to the target curve.  Changes must be saved to use the curve in the rest of the application.  This button is disabled when there are no changes.  Note - curves that come included with HouseCurve cannot be edited.

## Edit Status
Displays the name of the curve, if it has been changed, and curve fit setting.

## Plot Setup
Tap <img src="/assets/img/plot.png" alt="Plot Setup" class="app-icon"> to show the [Plot Setup screen](plot_setup.md).  Use this to choose curves and adjust fitting.

## Curve Source
Tap <img src="/assets/img/curvesource.png" alt="Plot Setup" class="app-icon"> to view and edit the target curve "source" file.  This screen is handy for cutting and pasting curve points, ex: from internet forums.

## New Curve
Tap <img src="/assets/img/newcurve.png" alt="Plot Setup" class="app-icon"> to create a new target curve.
