# Real Time Tool
Use the Real Time tool to measure your audio system with pink noise.

Pink noise spreads signal power over the entire audible range.  This means pink noise measurements will have a lower signal to noise ratio comared to sweeps.

The advantage of pink noise is that it can be used in real time.  This makes it possible to see the measurement change as an adjustment is being made, ex: moving a graphic EQ slider.  Pink noise can also be used to capture an average measurement of a listening area by moving the microphone (aka: "moving mic measurements", or MMM).

The Real Time tool displays live pink noise measurments on top of a target curve and optionally a saved measurement (see: [Plots](plots.md)).  The lower toolbar provides controls for real time measurements.  Some settings are shared with the Sweep tool.
