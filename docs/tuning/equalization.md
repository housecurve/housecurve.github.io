## Apply equalization
If the audio system has separately adjustable speakers, such as a subwoofer, ensure that levels have been [matched](match_levels.md), crossovers are [selected](crossover.md) and speakers are [time aligned](time_align.md).

### What is equalization?

Equalization means adjusting an audio system’s output such that the measured response in the listening area aligns with a target curve.  It can be used to compensate for characteristics of the audio system, or to correct for the effects of the room (aka “room correction”).  In practice, it's hard to separate the audio system from the room, so we end up adjusting for both.

When sound leaves an audio system, it interacts with the room, but this interaction changes with frequency.  Below the Schroeder frequency, or about 300 Hz, room resonances have a dominant impact on what is heard in the listening area.  At these frequencies, the room is in control.  Above the Schroeder frequency, direct sound from the audio system begins to dominate with contributions from room diffusion, absorption and reflection.  In this region, the audio system is mostly in control.  Thus, when equalizing a typical home or car audio system, we are correcting for the room below the Schroeder frequency and for the audio system above it (for an excellent deep dive, please read [Floyd Toole’s paper](https://www.harman.com/documents/AudioScience_0.pdf)).

When applying equalization, it is best to start at the low frequencies and work your way up.  At low frequencies, room resonances will create large peaks and dips in the magnitude.  These will be quite audible, so focus on smoothing them out to the target curve.  Moving toward higher frequencies, peaks and dips become much less audible and should not be adjusted.  Instead, shift your focus to adjusting wide regions of the magnitude response towards the target curve (an octave or more).  At the very upper end (10 KHz), it may not be worth making any adjustments at all (A great video on the topic is [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGd0aMn1wE)).

HouseCurve supports automatic and manual equalization:

- [Automatic equalization](#automatic-equalization), HouseCurve generates a set of filters to correct a measurement to a target curve.  If your audio system has a parametric equalizer, the filter parameters can be imported from a file, or manually entered.  Even without a parametric equalizer, the feature is still useful - you can see what HouseCurve would adjust and use that as a guide.

- [Manual equalization](#manual-equalization) is the most straight forward approach.  It works by iteratively measuring the audio system, adjusting it, then measuring again.  It will work with any audio system, even ones with limited adjustments (ex: you can move furniture and see the impact).

### Automatic Equalization

HouseCurve's automatic equalization tool generates filter settings for parametric equalizers.  It works by correcting a [saved measurement](../manual/plot_setup.md#saved-measurement) to a [target curve](../manual/plot_setup.md#target-curve).  It can be accessed from the more menu <img src="/assets/img/more.png" alt="More" class="app-icon">.  For best results **average several measurements** from the listening area and then save.  Averaging provides HouseCurve with a better picture of how sound changes in the listening area.

The image below shows a saved measurement (grey) being corrected to the target curve (yellow).  The filters that perform the correction are shown in magenta.  The predicted magnitude response (when filters are applied) is shown in cyan.

![equalize screen](/assets/img/equalize_biquads.png "Equalize screen showing correction filters and predicted output")

HouseCurve allocates filters to regions with the largest deviation from the target curve, starting with lower frequencies and ignoring blanked regions (see [Coherence Blanking](/../manual/plot_setup.md#coherence-blanking)).  The algorithm’s behavior can be controlled by tapping <img src="/assets/img/setup.png" alt="Setup" width="15"> to display the [equalize setup screen](../manual/equalize_setup.md).  Plot settings, such target curve fit and blanking threshold also impact the algorithm.  Changes are reflected immediately.

The predicted response should be reasonably close to real world measurements.  The screenshot below shows the same audio system after applying filters generated by HouseCurve (green) compared to the original measurement (grey).

HouseCurve uses a form of Infinite Impule Response (IIR) filter known as peaking biquad filter.  These are commonly used in graphic and parametric equalizers to boost or cut at various frequencies.  You can view the individual filters by tapping <img src="/assets/img/detail.png" alt="Detail" width="15"> to bring up the Filter Detail screen, shown below.  This screen can be used to manually enter filter settings into your audio system.

![filter detail screen](/assets/img/equalize_detail.png "Filter details can be imported into your parametric equalizer")

The filters can be [exported](../manual/filter_export.md) to a file by tapping <img src="/assets/img/export.png" alt="Export" width="15">.  This file can then be imported into a compatible parametric equalizer, such as a [miniDSP 2x4HD](https://www.minidsp.com/products/minidsp-in-a-box/minidsp-2x4-hd), or software based equalizers like [Equalizer APO](https://sourceforge.net/projects/equalizerapo/).

HouseCurve's biquad filters are based on the [Audio EQ Cookbook by Robert Bristow-Johnson](https://www.w3.org/TR/audio-eq-cookbook/).  **Warning** the biquad coefficients exported by HouseCurve may not be compatible with your audio system.  As a precaution, turn the volume down on the first import just in case.  If you have questions or experience problems, please [reach out](mailto:support@housecurve.com).

### Manual Equalization

Equalization means changing the volume level at different frequencies.  There are many ways an audio system can be changed to make this happen:

* Change speaker position in room
* Adjust the bass or treble controls
* Change relative levels of speakers (ex: subwoofer level)
* Adjust the graphic or parametric equalizer settings
* Change the room (ex: sound dampening, adjust furniture)

When equalizing, the goal is to adjust the audio system such that the average magnitude measurement ends up within the +/- 3 dB band that surrounds the Target Curve.

![equalization start](/assets/img/equalizer_start.png "Adjust until measurement within target curve band")

Adjust the audio system in small steps, collecting the same measurements after each change.  [Saved measurements](../manual/plot_setup.md#saved-measurement) are helpful for seeing the effect of an adjustment as can be seen below.  You can also take a look at the [Automatic Equalization](automatic-equalization) screen to see what HouseCurve would equalize (based on the saved measurement).

![equalization changed](/assets/img/equalizer_changed.png "Save measurements to see what adjustment did")

When most of the average magnitude measurement is within the target band, the audio system is sufficiently equalized.  Further adjustments may not be perceptible.

Avoid adjustments that are beyond the capability of the audio system.  Doing so will lead to distortion and possibly audio system damage.  Keep in mind that a +10 dB adjustment means the audio system has to output 10 times more signal power.  A change of +20 dB is 100 times more signal power!
