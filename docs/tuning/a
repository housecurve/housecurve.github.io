./target_curve.md:HouseCurve provides a [Curve Editor](../manual/curve_edit.md) for tweaking curves or making your own.  It can be accessed from the more menu <img src="/assets/img/more.png" alt="More" class="app-icon">.  Curve files can also be [imported](../manual/plot_setup.md#target-curve) into HouseCurve.  See curve file [format](../manual/file_formats.md#curves) for details.
./target_curve.md:HouseCurve ships with two common curves for home listening: [B&K](/curves/B&K.txt) and [Harman](/curves/Harman.txt).  These can be selected by going to [Plot Setup](../manual/plot_setup.md).  Some additional curves are provided below for automobiles.  These curves have significantly more bass which is common for automobile listing.
./time_align.md:Set HouseCurve’s Plot Mode to [History](../manual/plot_setup.md#plot-mode).  Zoom into the region around the crossover frequency.
./time_align.md:Set the [Target Curve Fit](../manual/plot_setup.md#target-curve-fit) to manual and select an appropriate level.  This will stop the target curve from shifting slightly between measurements, providing a better reference.
./time_align.md:Time alignment using phase requires separate measurement of the speakers on either side of the crossover.  To do this with HouseCurve, measurements of the first speaker are [saved](../manual/plot_setup.md#saved-measurement) so that they can be compared to measurements of the second speaker.  As adjustments are made, measurements of the second speaker are repeated.
./time_align.md:Set HouseCurve’s Plot Mode to [History](../manual/plot_setup.md#plot-mode).  Switch to the phase plot and zoom into the region around the crossover frequency.  Place the cursor at the crossover frequency.
./equalization.md:1. **Lower the target curve** - To avoid increasing the overall gain, you can manually lower the target curve (see: [target curve fit](../manual/plot_setup.md#target-curve-fit)).  This will cause more of the measurement to appear above the target curve, effectively increasing the number and size of cuts needed to correct.  The results is lower overall system gain.
./equalization.md:1. **Avoid correcting beyond the capabilites of the system** - A small bookshelf speaker may have a low frequency limit of 50 Hz (-6 dB).  Applying a +10 dB boost at 30 Hz to get more bass is going to drive the speaker beyond its capabilities and lead to distortion (and possibly damage).  When [Coherence Blanking](../manual/plot_setup.md#coherence-blanking) is enabled, the low frequency capability of the speaker is more obvious.  If the speaker can't produce 30 Hz, this portion of the measurement will not be displayed.
./equalization.md:HouseCurve's [Equalize Tool](../manual/equalize_tool.md) generates filters to correct a [saved measurement](../manual/plot_setup.md#saved-measurement) to a [target curve](../manual/plot_setup.md#target-curve).  It can be accessed from the more menu <img src="/assets/img/more.png" alt="More" class="app-icon">.
./equalization.md:HouseCurve allocates filters to regions with the largest deviation from the target curve, starting with lower frequencies and ignoring blanked regions (see [Coherence Blanking](/../manual/plot_setup.md#coherence-blanking)).  The algorithm’s behavior can be controlled by tapping <img src="/assets/img/setup.png" alt="Setup" class="app-icon"> to display the [equalize setup screen](../manual/equalize_setup.md).  Plot settings, such target curve fit and blanking threshold also impact the algorithm.  The display automatically updates to reflect any setting change.
./equalization.md:Adjust the audio system in small steps, collecting the same measurements after each change.  [Saved measurements](../manual/plot_setup.md#saved-measurement) are helpful for seeing the effect of an adjustment as can be seen below.  You can also take a look at the [Equalize Tool](#automatic-equalization) to see what HouseCurve would equalize (based on the saved measurement).
./crossover.md:The classic approach is to select crossover frequencies based on speaker specifications, but these may not reflect how the speakers perform in the room.  It is better to measure the actual speaker performance. Use [saved measurements](../manual/plot_setup.md#saved-measurments), to compare speakers and select a crossover frequency.
./match_levels.md:Make sure all speakers are active and set the overall audio system volume to a normal listening level.  It can be helpful to set HouseCurve’s [Plot Mode](../manual/plot_setup.md#plot-mode) to History.
