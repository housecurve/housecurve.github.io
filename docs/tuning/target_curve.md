# Choose Target curve

A Target Curve, or “house curve”, is a visual guide to tune your audio system.  The system is "tuned" when the average  measurement matches the Target Curve.  HouseCurve displays the selected curve on the magnitude plot when there are measurements:

![target curve](/assets/img/target_curve.png "Measurement compared to B&K target curve (yellow)")

The choice of Target Curve is subject to individual taste.  Typically, listeners prefer it when low frequencies are louder than high frequencies.  A  downward slope of 1 dB/octave is quite common.  Let your ears be the judge.


## Creating and editing curves

HouseCurve provides a [Curve Editor](../manual/curve_edit.md) for tweaking curves or making your own.  It can be accessed from the more menu <img src="/assets/img/more.png" alt="More" class="app-icon">.  Curve files can also be [imported](../manual/plot_setup.md#target-curve) into HouseCurve.  See curve file [format](../manual/file_formats.md#curves) for details.

HouseCurve ships with two common curves for home listening: [B&K](/curves/B&K.txt) and [Harman](/curves/Harman.txt).  These can be selected by going to [Plot Setup](../manual/plot_setup.md).  Some additional curves are provided below for automobiles.  These curves have significantly more bass which is common for automobile listing.

* [Car A](/curves/Car_A_web.txt)
* [Car B](/curves/Car_B_web.txt)
* [Car C](/curves/Car_C_web.txt)

In the audiophile world, a “flat” response is often seen as the ultimate goal.  However, for everyday listening, a flat response tends to sound overly “bright” and unpleasant.  Try it for yourself: [Flat Target Curve](/curves/flat.txt).
