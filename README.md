### How does HouseCurve work?

HouseCurve measures in-room frequency response by listening to your audio system play a sine sweep.  Measurements are displayed on top of a target curve, making it easy to see where adjustment is needed.  Multiple measurements can be averaged to fully capture how the system sounds in the listening area.  With small changes and repeat measurements, you can manually tune your system to the target curve.  If your audio system has a parametric equalizer, HouseCurve can automatically generate filter settings to match the target curve.

HouseCurve can help with home and car [audio system tuning](/TUNING.md), from system [equalization and room correction](/TUNING.md#apply-equalization) to [subwoofer time alignment](/TUNING.md#time-align-speakers) and speaker placement.  Visit housecurve.com for more information on how HouseCurve works and how to use it.

HouseCurve will produce acceptable results with the built in iPhone/iPad microphone. Using calibrated external microphones will provide higher accuracy.
