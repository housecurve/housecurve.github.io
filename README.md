### How does HouseCurve work?

HouseCurve works by playing a log sine sweep through your audio system and measuring the in-room frequency response.  Multiple measurements are averaged to fully capture how the system sounds in the listening area.  Measurements are displayed on top of the reference curve, making it easy to see where your system needs adjustment.  With small changes and repeat measurements, you can tune your system to the reference curve.

HouseCurve can help with home and car [audio system tuning](/TUNING.md), from speaker placement and [equalizer settings](/TUNING.md#apply-equalization) to [subwoofer time alignment](/TUNING.md#time-align-speakers) and room treatments.

HouseCurve will produce acceptable results with the built in iPhone/iPad microphone. Using calibrated external microphones will provide higher accuracy.
